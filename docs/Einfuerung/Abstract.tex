To increase the efficiency of a company, it requires realtime
information about its workflows. Between the data capturing
and the aha experience, which you get by viewing a 
insightful dashboard, lies a long journey. Fortunately,
the master thesis is collaborating with the company GBO Datacomp,
which already provides solutions for the assessment, compaction and
storage of the data. The thesis deals with the design of a system
which transports data in a performant and secure way, provides
flexible processing and gives users the opportunity to access
the data in a web-based dashboarding tool.
